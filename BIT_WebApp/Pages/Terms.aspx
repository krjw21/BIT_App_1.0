        <p class="terms-header">BIT Field Support Services Terms & Conditions</p>
        <p class="terms-content">Effective March 13, 2022</p>
        <p class="terms-header">What you can expect from us</p>
        <p class="terms-sub-header">Provide a broad range of useful services</p>
        <p class="terms-content">- Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.</p>
        <p class="terms-content">We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.</p>
        <p class="terms-header">What we expect from you</p>
        <p class="terms-content">We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site.</p>
        <p class="terms-content" id="bottom-content">- Our service-specific additional terms and policies provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.</p>
