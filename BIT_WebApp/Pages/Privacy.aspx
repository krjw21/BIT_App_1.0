        <p class="terms-header">BIT Field Support Services Privacy Policy</p>
        <p class="terms-content">Effective February 12, 2022</p>
        <p class="terms-header">When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.</p>
        <p class="terms-sub-header">This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.</p>
        <p class="terms-content">- You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.</p>
        <p class="terms-content">We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.</p>
        <p class="terms-header">We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services</p>
        <p class="terms-content">We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.</p>
        <p class="terms-content" id="bottom-content">- The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.</p>
